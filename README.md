Adventure Quest!!

You've been isekaid to another world.
Your goal is to go back to where you came from.
Talk to the NPC to know how to get home.

...
But how does said NPC know how to get you back home?
It's like they're the reason you're here in the first place.
But it can't be that right?

It's an old game that I've been wanting to make a remake of and/or make a part 2 of it.
Fair warning, It's very buggy.
